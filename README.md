Antakshari-App
==============

This is an in-progress iOS app for a popular Indian singing game called Antakshari.  The game consists of a certain number of teams, who take turns singing songs that either start with the same letter the previous song ended with, or that fall within certain categories.  This app facilitates playing that game, by providing built-in categories and hints, lyrics search, and easy to manage team, player, and score keeping functionalities.

The idea for this app was a collaboration between my friends and I.  I developed this iOS app, while my friends are working together to develop the Android app.  Once both are finished, we will publish them to their respective App Stores.
